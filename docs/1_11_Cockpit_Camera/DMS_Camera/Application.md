# DMS Camera Application Analysis: The Core Sensor for Smart Cabin Safety

With the continuous advancement of driving technology, the focus of driving safety has shifted from "external environment perception" to "in-cabin behavior recognition." The Driver Monitoring System (DMS) is a key component of smart cabin safety, playing a vital role in advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) and overall vehicle safety.

## 1. Core Functions of DMS Camera

The DMS camera is typically installed on the dashboard or steering column, enabling real-time acquisition of the driver's face, eyes, head, and upper body images. Its main functions include:

- **Fatigue Detection:** Monitors eye closure and blinking (PERCLOS) to determine if the driver is experiencing fatigue.
- **Attention Monitoring:** Detects the driver's line of sight and head orientation to assess attentiveness.
- **Dangerous Behavior Detection:** Identifies risky behaviors such as using a phone, smoking, or looking away from the road.
- **Driver Identification:** Uses facial recognition to verify driver identity and prevent unauthorized use.

## 2. Technical Features and Advantages

To meet the high reliability and all-weather requirements of automotive applications, our DMS camera offers the following technical advantages:

- **High Dynamic Range Global Shutter Sensor:** Delivers clear images even in challenging lighting conditions.
- **940nm Infrared Illumination:** Enhances eye and facial recognition performance in low-light or nighttime environments.
- **Full-Frame Global Shutter:** Prevents motion blur, ensuring accurate behavior analysis.
- **RGB/IR Dual Imaging Capability (Optional):** Supports seamless switching between visible (RGB) and infrared (IR) imaging, ensuring high-quality data in all scenarios.
