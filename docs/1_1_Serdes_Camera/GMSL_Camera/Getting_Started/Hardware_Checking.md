# Hardware Checking

Before installing the camera, please carefully check the following hardware aspects to ensure proper functionality.

## 1. Camera Connector

The camera uses an **Amphenol Fakra (Z Code)** connector for signal transmission. This connector is specifically designed for automotive applications and provides reliable high-speed data transmission.

- Secure locking mechanism
- IP67 waterproof rating

## 2. Mount of Camera

Our cameras are available in two lens mounting types:

### AA (Active Alignment) 
The AA type lens features an advanced mounting technology that ensures precise optical alignment.

  <p style={{color: '#666', fontSize: '0.9em'}}>AA Lens Structure and Mounting Process</p>
</div>

Key features of AA lens:
- Active alignment during assembly
- Precise optical axis alignment
- Enhanced image quality
- Suitable for high-precision applications

### S-Mount
The threaded lens mount provides a traditional mechanical mounting solution.

  <p style={{color: '#666', fontSize: '0.9em'}}>Threaded Lens Mount</p>
</div>

Comparison between AA and Threaded types:
| Feature | AA Type | Threaded Type |
|---------|---------|---------------|
| Mounting Method | Active Alignment | Mechanical Thread |
| Precision | High | Standard |
| Cost | Higher | Lower |
| Assembly Time | Longer | Shorter |
| Maintenance | Complex | Simple |

## 3. Heating Feature
