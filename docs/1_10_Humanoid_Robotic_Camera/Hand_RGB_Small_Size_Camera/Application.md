## Technical Features

### Onsemi Ultra-Small AR0341AT Image Sensor

The AR0341AT is one of the first products in Onsemi's new Hyperlux image sensor series. It is equipped with second-generation super exposure pixel technology, offering an industry-leading 150 dB high dynamic range (HDR) and LED flicker mitigation (LFM) functionality. This pixel technology significantly reduces latency in critical automotive systems that depend on scene-specific automatic exposure control operations, enabling faster and safer data collection and decision-making.

With no compromise on performance, the AR0341AT image sensor, featuring a 2.1 µm pixel size and 3MP resolution, achieves the industry's smallest automotive camera with its small optical size and industry-leading low power consumption. Additionally, the AR0341AT image sensor is designed following ASIL-C design processes and surpasses ASIL-B hardware standards with its complex real-time safety mechanisms and fault detection features.

### Outstanding Performance

#### 1. Excellent HDR Performance

The high dynamic range (HDR) of the AR0341AT image sensor is 150 dB, which can capture high-quality images under the most extreme lighting conditions without sacrificing low light sensitivity. As one of the first products to adopt Hyperlux technology, AR0341AT boasts excellent HDR performance. Hyperlux can provide vivid, sharp, and detailed images. Due to its extremely stable and unaffected by temperature or lighting conditions, it lays the foundation for higher safety designs.

As shown in the figure below, the Hyperlux sensor performs well in the most demanding environments and extreme conditions.

#### 2. Leading Ultra-Low Power Consumption and Small Size

As more image sensors are added to vehicles, their size and power consumption have become design considerations for the automotive industry. The AR0341AT image sensor features industry-leading ultra-low power consumption and small size. Compared to other image sensors, the AR0341AT reduces power consumption by up to 30% and footprint by up to 28%, enabling a high-efficiency design with lower system material costs.

#### 3. Excellent LED Flicker Mitigation (LFM) Performance

The AR0341AT image sensor prevents machine vision issues caused by LED flickering. With Hyperlux technology, the sensor's LFM capabilities ensure that pulsed light sources do not flicker, avoiding machine vision problems caused by flicker and significantly improving driving safety standards to support high-speed autonomous driving.

#### 4. Real-Time Functional Security Mechanism

The AR0341AT image sensor, adopting Hyperlux technology, meets the strict safety requirements of ASIL D-rated automotive safety integrity systems. The integrated security features provide maximum protection against cybersecurity threats. Hyperlux series sensors also offer dual output streams at different resolutions, allowing simultaneous perception and other functions. Designers benefit from its flexible architecture, enabling multiple functions with a single camera, reducing design time, risk, and cost.
