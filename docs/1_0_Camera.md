## Implementation Examples & Best Practices

### Professional Camera Integration Framework

The following examples demonstrate industry-standard approaches to camera system integration, featuring robust error handling, optimal performance patterns, and production-ready code structures.

#### **V4L2 Camera Initialization (Linux)**

```c
/* Example code for capturing camera frames */
#include "camera_api.h"

int main() {
    // Initialize camera
    camera_init();
    
    // Open camera device
    int fd = open("/dev/video0", O_RDWR);
    if (fd < 0) {
        perror("Failed to open camera device");
        return -1;
    }
    
    // Configure video capture format
    struct v4l2_format fmt = {0};
    fmt.type = V4L2_BUF_TYPE_VIDEO_CAPTURE;
    fmt.fmt.pix.width = 1920;
    fmt.fmt.pix.height = 1536;
    fmt.fmt.pix.pixelformat = V4L2_PIX_FMT_UYVY;
    
    if (ioctl(fd, VIDIOC_S_FMT, &fmt) < 0) {
        perror("Failed to set format");
        close(fd);
        return -1;
    }
    
    // Request and map buffers
    // ... (buffer setup code) ...
    
    // Start streaming
    // ... (streaming code) ...
    
    // Capture and process frames
    // ... (frame processing code) ...
