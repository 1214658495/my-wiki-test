## Key Considerations

When selecting a camera technology for your application, evaluate these critical factors:

<div className="considerations">

### Technical Specifications

- **Resolution**: Pixel density determining image detail (from VGA to 8K+)
- **Frame Rate**: Number of images captured per second (from 30fps to 1000fps+)
- **Interface**: Communication protocol and physical connection (USB, CSI-2, CoaXPress, GigE)
- **Shutter Type**: Global vs. Rolling shutter mechanisms and their impact on motion capture
- **Spectral Sensitivity**: Wavelength range the sensor can detect (visible, NIR, SWIR, etc.)

### Performance Factors

- **Dynamic Range**: Ability to capture both bright and dark areas simultaneously (measured in dB)
- **Latency**: Delay between capture and data availability (critical for real-time applications)
- **Signal-to-Noise Ratio**: Quality of the image signal relative to noise levels
- **Power Consumption**: Energy requirements, especially critical for mobile and battery-powered systems
- **Form Factor**: Physical size, weight, and mounting options compatibility

### Environmental Considerations

- **Operating Temperature Range**: Minimum and maximum temperatures for reliable operation
- **Ingress Protection (IP) Rating**: Resistance to dust and moisture
- **Vibration Resistance**: Ability to maintain performance under mechanical stress
- **Electromagnetic Compatibility**: Resistance to interference and emissions compliance

## Code Examples

### Camera Initialization Example

```cpp
// Sample initialization for a rolling shutter camera
RollingShutterCamera camera;
CameraConfig config;

// Configure camera parameters
config.resolution = Resolution(1920, 1080);
config.frameRate = 120;
config.exposureMode = ExposureMode::MANUAL;
config.exposureTime = 10000; // in microseconds

// Initialize the camera with configuration
if (camera.initialize(config)) {
    camera.startCapture();
    
    // Capture frame
    Frame frame = camera.captureFrame();
    
    // Process frame
    // ...
    
    camera.stopCapture();
} else {
    std::cerr << "Camera initialization failed: " << camera.getLastError() << std::endl;
}
```
