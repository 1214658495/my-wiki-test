# Application

A starlight camera is capable of capturing clear images in low-light (starlight-level) environments without the need for any auxiliary lighting. SENSING launched the starlight camera module, features a 2M low-light image sensor and a high-performance ISP chip, the image quality has been significantly upgraded, enabling high-quality imaging during both day and night. It is ideal for low-light scenarios and applications requiring different light condition detection.

## What is a Starlight Camera?

Low-light camera levels are typically categorized as follows:

- 0.1 lux: Low light level
- 0.01 lux: Moonlight level
- 0.001 lux: Starlight level

A starlight camera is capable of capturing clear images in low-light (starlight-level) environments without the need for any auxiliary lighting.

## Starlight-Level Night Vision Imaging

The SN2M4EFGD starlight camera module features a 2MP low-light image sensor with a larger photosensitive area per pixel, providing enhanced sensitivity for low-light imaging. It can capture even the faintest light signals. In starlight-level lighting conditions, this camera can produce clear, full-color images without the need for any auxiliary lighting.
