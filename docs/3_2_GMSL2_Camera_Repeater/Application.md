## GMSL2 Camera Repeater Applications

The SENSING GMSL2 Camera Repeater is an essential component for extending GMSL2 transmission distances while maintaining signal integrity. This document outlines the key applications and use cases for implementing the GMSL2 Repeater in automotive, industrial, and robotics environments.

## Automotive Applications

### Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS)

    style={{maxWidth: '100%', height:'auto'}} />
</div>
<br />

The GMSL2 Camera Repeater serves as a critical component in ADAS implementations where cameras need to be positioned at significant distances from the processing ECU:

- **Surround View Systems**: Enables seamless integration of multiple cameras positioned around the vehicle perimeter
- **Forward-Facing Camera Systems**: Extends the transmission distance for long-range detection cameras
- **Lane Departure Warning Systems**: Ensures reliable signal transmission from cameras to ECU over extended distances

### Camera Monitoring Systems (CMS)

In CMS applications where traditional mirrors are replaced with cameras:

- **Side-View Camera Systems**: Repeaters allow flexible camera placement while maintaining signal quality
- **Rear-View Camera Systems**: Enables reliable signal transmission from trunk-mounted cameras to dashboard displays
- **Commercial Vehicle Applications**: Supports extended cable runs in larger vehicles like trucks and buses

    style={{maxWidth: '80%', height:'auto'}} />
</div>

For AGVs operating in large warehouses or manufacturing facilities:

- **Obstacle Detection**: Extends camera coverage for real-time obstacle detection
- **Path Following**: Enables floor-line tracking cameras to be optimally positioned
- **Navigation Systems**: Supports multiple camera integration for comprehensive environment perception

### Machine Vision Systems

In industrial automation and quality control:

- **Assembly Line Inspection**: Allows cameras to be positioned optimally without distance constraints
- **Robotic Arm Vision**: Extends camera signals from moving robotic components to stationary controllers
- **Quality Control Systems**: Enables high-resolution camera placement in challenging industrial environments -->
