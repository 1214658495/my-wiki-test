## SENSING Technology Releases 5MP RGB-IR Camera for Jetson AGX Orin

<!-- *2023-06-09 12:58* -->

In the era of artificial intelligence, the integration of computer vision technology into automotive electronics has become an industry trend. However, traditional "RGB" camera technology cannot meet the requirements of high-precision detection. For applications requiring facial recognition, traditional RGB cameras may not perform well in low-light conditions. RGB-IR technology combines the advantages of both RGB and infrared, providing enhanced performance in low-light environments. By integrating RGB-IR camera technology, it's possible to achieve excellent facial recognition capabilities in various lighting conditions.

## SENSING RGB-IR Camera

Recently, SENSING Technology (Shenzhen) Co., Ltd. has independently developed and launched a 5MP RGB-IR global shutter camera module. This camera is designed for the NVIDIA Jetson platform and has been successfully tested on the Jetson AGX Orin. The camera integrates OmniVision's 5MP OX05B1S RGB-IR sensor, OAX4000 ISP, and Maxim's Max9295A GMSL2 serializer. It features a high-quality M12 automotive-grade lens that supports both visible light and 940nm infrared light recognition, offering excellent performance in low-light conditions.

Based on the OX05B1S sensor, SENSING's RGB-IR camera can output both RGB and IR images simultaneously. The camera supports 5MP full-resolution output at 30fps. In low-light conditions, it can switch to infrared mode for enhanced visibility. It supports AA/AB modes with different resolutions and frame rates. In AA mode, it outputs 2592H×1944V at 30fps; in AB mode, it outputs 2592H×1800V at 60fps.

The camera's compact design measures 28.8 × 44.2 × 20mm and weighs less than 75g. It features a durable metal housing with excellent heat dissipation and is designed for easy installation and use.

This camera is ideal for various applications including in-vehicle monitoring systems, driver fatigue detection, and other computer vision tasks. The combination of OMS RGB-IR and GMSL technology makes it suitable for automotive applications, providing high reliability and excellent performance in various lighting conditions. It's particularly valuable for driver monitoring systems (DMS) and in-cabin monitoring systems (ICMS), enhancing driving safety.
